    "GET and POST are two HTTP methods used to send data to a web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GET method is used to request data from the server. When a user clicks on a link, the browser sends a GET request to the server to retrieve the resource identified by the link. The data is appended to the URL as query parameters, which are visible in the browser's address bar. GET requests are typically used for retrieving data, but not for modifying it, since the data is exposed in the URL and can be easily manipulated by a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The POST method, on the other hand, is used to submit data to the server to create or update a resource. When a user submits a form, the data is sent to the server using a POST request, and the data is included in the body of the request, rather than in the URL. POST requests are typically used for submitting data, such as user input, and are more secure than GET requests, since the data is not exposed in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
